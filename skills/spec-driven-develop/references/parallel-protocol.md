# Parallel Execution Protocol

This protocol defines how the generated sub-SKILL (and the agent using it) should leverage sub-agents during actual development work. It applies throughout the implementation, not to a specific phase.

---

## When to Parallelize

At the start of each development phase, consult `docs/plan/task-breakdown.md` for parallel lane assignments:
- If a phase has **multiple parallel lanes**, launch one `task-executor` sub-agent per lane simultaneously
- If a phase has **only one lane** (all tasks are sequential), execute tasks one by one — do not force parallelism
- If the platform does not support sub-agents, execute all tasks sequentially yourself

---

## How to Launch Parallel Task Executors

For each parallel lane in the current phase:

1. Prepare the input for each `task-executor` agent:
   - Task ID and description from the plan
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Relevant source file paths (from `docs/analysis/module-inventory.md`)
   - Coding standards from the sub-SKILL
   - Summary of completed prerequisite tasks and their outputs

2. Launch all lane agents **in a single message** (this is how platforms achieve true parallelism). Use worktree isolation if available to prevent file conflicts between agents.

3. When all agents return, consolidate their results:
   - Verify each agent reported DONE (not BLOCKED)
   - If any agent is BLOCKED, resolve the blocker and re-launch only that agent
   - If agents worked in worktrees, merge their changes sequentially, resolving any conflicts
   - Run the project's full test suite to verify combined changes are coherent

---

## Progress Synchronization

After consolidating parallel results:
- Verify that each agent's progress file updates are consistent
- If agents wrote to the same progress file, reconcile the updates (agents may have stale counts)
- Update MASTER.md with the final accurate completion counts
- Update the platform's native task tool to reflect all completed tasks

---

## Merge Risk Mitigation

The `task-breakdown.md` includes merge risk ratings for parallel lanes. Apply these safeguards:
- **Low risk**: Merge freely — lanes touch different files
- **Medium risk**: Merge sequentially, run tests between each merge
- **High risk**: Consider running these tasks sequentially instead of in parallel, or use worktree isolation with careful conflict resolution
