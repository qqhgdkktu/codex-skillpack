# Sub-SKILL Template

When generating a task-specific sub-SKILL in Phase 5, delegate to the platform's native skill-creator. The sub-SKILL is always installed at **project level** to keep it co-located with the project it serves.

---

## Metadata

- **Name**: `<task-type>-dev` (e.g., `rust-migration-dev`, `microservice-overhaul-dev`)
- **Description**: Should reference the specific task and include trigger keywords
- **Installation**: Project level (e.g., `.cursor/skills/`, `.claude/commands/`, or project-local directory)

---

## Content Outline

The generated sub-SKILL must include these sections **in this order**:

### 1. Cross-Conversation Continuity Protocol

Read `docs/progress/MASTER.md` first, always. Identify active phase/task and resume from where the last session left off.

### 2. S.U.P.E.R Architecture Principles (MUST be inlined)

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT merely reference `super-philosophy.md`. The sub-SKILL must **embed the full S.U.P.E.R principles inline** so that the executing agent has direct access without needing to read an external file. Include the following content verbatim in the generated sub-SKILL:

```markdown
## S.U.P.E.R Architecture — Mandatory Coding Standard

> Write code like building with LEGO — each brick has a single job, a standard interface, a clear direction, runs anywhere, and can be swapped at will.

All code produced in this project MUST conform to these five principles. Violations are treated as bugs.

### S — Single Purpose
- Each module, file, and function solves exactly one problem
- Prefer decomposition; power comes from composition
- **Litmus test**: Can you describe this module's responsibility in a single sentence? If not, split it.

### U — Unidirectional Flow
- Data flows in one direction: input → processing → output
- Dependencies point inward: outer layers depend on inner, inner layers know nothing about outer
- No circular imports, no reverse dependencies
- **Litmus test**: Can the core logic run unit tests with zero external services?

### P — Ports over Implementation
- Define interface contracts (JSON Schema, types, data structures) BEFORE writing implementation
- All cross-module I/O must be serializable
- Swapping a data source, render layer, or notification channel requires zero changes to core logic
- **Practice**: Every module boundary communicates via explicit, schema-defined contracts

### E — Environment-Agnostic
- Configuration via environment variables or config files, never hardcoded
- All dependencies explicitly declared (requirements.txt / package.json / Cargo.toml)
- Processes are stateless; persistence delegated to external storage
- Logs to stdout. Same codebase runs locally, in Docker, on cloud
- **Config precedence**: Environment variables > .env > config file > in-code defaults

### R — Replaceable Parts
- Any layer can be replaced without affecting others
- Replacement cost is THE core metric of architecture quality
- If replacing one component triggers cascading changes, the architecture is broken
- **Validation**: For each module, ask "Can I swap this with a different implementation by only touching this module's directory?"
```

### 3. S.U.P.E.R Code Review Checklist (mandatory after each task)

The sub-SKILL must include this checklist and instruct the agent to run it after completing every task:

```markdown
## S.U.P.E.R Code Review — Run After Every Task

Before marking any task as complete, verify ALL of the following:

| # | Check | Principle | Pass? |
|:--|:------|:----------|:------|
| 1 | Every new module/file has exactly one responsibility | S | |
| 2 | No function does more than one conceptual thing | S | |
| 3 | Data flows input → processing → output, no reverse deps | U | |
| 4 | No circular imports introduced | U | |
| 5 | Cross-module interfaces are schema-defined (types/contracts) | P | |
| 6 | Module I/O is serializable | P | |
| 7 | No hardcoded paths, URLs, keys, or config values | E | |
| 8 | All new dependencies explicitly declared in dependency file | E | |
| 9 | New modules can be replaced without changes to other modules | R | |
| 10 | All tests pass after the change | — | |

**Scoring**: All pass = ✅ proceed. 1-2 fail = fix before marking complete. 3+ fail = stop and refactor.
```

### 4. Target Technology Coding Standards

Conventions for the target language/framework. These should be concrete and actionable, not generic advice. Examples:
- Naming conventions, file organization patterns
- Error handling approach (aligned with S.U.P.E.R — errors flow unidirectionally)
- Testing strategy (unit tests for core logic with zero external deps, per U principle)
- Dependency injection patterns (per P principle — ports/interfaces first)

### 5. Project-Specific Architecture Context

Architecture context derived from `docs/analysis/` and the S.U.P.E.R health assessment from `risk-assessment.md`. Include:
- Which S.U.P.E.R violations from the current codebase must be fixed during this task
- The target architecture's layered model (per U principle)
- Key interface contracts that tasks must conform to (per P principle)

### 6. Progress Update Instructions

How to update checkboxes and MASTER.md counts after completing each task. Remind the agent:
- Update checkbox in phase file
- Update completion count in MASTER.md
- Update "Current Status" section
- Run the S.U.P.E.R Code Review Checklist before marking complete

### 7. Parallel Execution Protocol

Reference `references/parallel-protocol.md` for the full protocol. Summarize key points:
- Check `task-breakdown.md` for parallel lane assignments
- Launch one `task-executor` per lane simultaneously
- Each executor follows S.U.P.E.R principles independently
- Consolidate results and run full test suite after merge

### 8. Archive Trigger

When all tasks are done, initiate Phase 7 (Archive). Move all artifacts to `docs/archives/<project>/`.
